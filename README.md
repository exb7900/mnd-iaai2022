This project is predicting micronutrient deficiency (lack of vitamins and minerals) regionally in Madagascar, in hopes of supporting distribution of vitamin supplements and other interventions in the future. We are attempting to do this prediction due to the difficulty in collecting ground truth information about at-risk regions. The prediction is using satellite data, under the hypothesis that access to resources impacts micronutrient deficiency. 

To run, start with generate-predictor-rasters.ipynb if you need to download satellite data. Once you have data, run main.ipynb.
